# Backpropagation
In this exercise I will use backpropagation to train a multi-layer perceptron (with a single hidden layer). The experiment deals with different patterns and see how quickly or slowly the weights converge. Then it shows the impact and interplay of different parameters such as learning rate, number of iterations, and number of data points.
